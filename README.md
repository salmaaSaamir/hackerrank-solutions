# 🏆 HackerRank Problem Solving – C# Solutions

Welcome to my **HackerRank Problem Solving** repository 🎯  
Here I collect and organize my solutions to coding challenges I solve on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/salmasaamir554) using **C#**.  

The goal of this repo is not only to practice problem-solving, but also to:
- 🚀 Continuously **improve** my solutions and optimize them.
- 🧩 Build strong foundations in **Data Structures & Algorithms**.
- 📚 Stay up to date with **C# latest features** and apply them.
- 💡 Document my thought process & coding practice
